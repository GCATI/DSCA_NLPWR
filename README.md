Introduction to Natural Language Processing in R

**Course Summary**

Natural Language Processing is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence. 
It is used for processing and analysing large amounts of natural language (texts). 
Some applications include search engines (Google), text classification (spam filters),
identifying sentiments for a product (sentiment analysis), methods for discovering 
abstract topics in a collection of documents (topic modelling) and machine translation technologies.
In this course you learn about exploratory analysis of text data, introduced to sentiment analysis of texts using sentiment lexicons and the concept of topic modelling (package topicmodels).

**Learning Objective**

At the end of this course you should be able to set text data into a form that can be used for analysis, carry out cleaning of text data, exploratory analysis of text data, use meta-data to produce interesting visual displays depicting features of the text data, carry out sentiment analysis using  sentiment lexicons and discover topics in a corpus.

**Intended Audience**

Open to all (who fulfil) basic pre-requisites and who have in interest in this field. It would be
particularly relevant to those who deal regularly with natural language at scale.

**Learning Objective**

At the end of this course participants will be able to:

*	Describe the main components of language structure
*	Perform pre-processing (cleaning) operations on text.
*	Apply methods from Corpus Linguistics to garner greater insights on a corpus.
*	Produce word-clouds, bar charts and other basic visualisations on variables of interest.

**Course Type** (Fixed length list.)

* E learning - Available 
* Self learning -  Not Available
* Face to face - Available 

**Skill Level**

Competency in using the R Programming language to perform basic data manipulation is reqiured. For that refer to Intro to R (https://github.com/datasciencecampus/DSCA_Intro-R)

**Pre requisite summary** 

Participants should download the R studio to their device and should also download all course content from the 
given Github repository.  The r markdown (.Rmd) files are provided so that you can experiment with the code as you go through the material. I have deposited here the .html files resulting from "knitting" the .Rmd files. Please, note that the "NLPWR_part3.Rmd" takes quite a while to knit for the first time.
