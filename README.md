# NLPWR
A repo for training materials for the "NLP with R" course.

Natural Language Processing with R is a first introduction to the analysis of text data.

The course is based on the "tidy text" approach (tidytext package).

The intended audience is analysts who have not worked with text data before but are used to working with numerical and strings data.

A pre-requisite for this course is "Data Science with R" <https://github.com/datasciencecampus/DSWR>.

In this course you learn about carrying out exploratory analysis of text data, you are introduced to sentiment analysis using sentiment lexicons and an introduction to topic modelling is given (package topicmodels).

At the end of this course you should be able to set text data into a form that can be used for analysis, carry out cleaning of text data, exploratory analysis of text data, use meta-data to produce interesting visual displays depicting features of the text data, carry out sentiment analysis using  sentiment lexicons and discover topics in a corpus.

The .Rmd files are provided so that you can experiment with the code as you go through the material. I have deposited here the .html files resulting from "knitting" the .Rmd files. Please, note that the "NLPWR_part3.Rmd" takes quite a while to knit for the first time.
